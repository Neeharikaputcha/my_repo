## Git, GitHub

1. *What is your GitHub username?*
neeharikaputcha

2. *What is the URL of your remote GitHub repo (created through Mr. Kennedy's exercises)?*
https://github.com/Neeharikaputcha/my_repo.git
## R

The command below will load the tidyverse package.  If you have installed R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package, it should display a list of loaded packages and their versions.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## R Markdown 

1. *Create a bulleted list with at least 3 items*

2. *Write a single paragraph that demonstrates the use of italics, bold, bold italics, code, and includes a link. The paragraph does not have to make sense.*
On January 27, 1880, *Thomas Edison* received the historic patent embodying the principles of his **incandescent lamp** that paved the way for the universal domestic use of ***electric light***.

3. *Create a level 3 heading*
 ### I love coding

#### Data Visualization Exercises

1. (Q2) *How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?*
```{r}
ggplot2::mpg
```

1. (Q4) *Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.*
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))
```


#### Workflow: basics Exercises

1. (Q2) *Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly (`library(tidyverse)` is correct):*

```r
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)

filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
filter(mpg, cyl == 8)
filter(diamonds, carat > 3)
```

## Google Colab

1. *What are the URLs of your Google Colab notebooks (both Python and R)?*

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PUl1iuMyCr3voVdmF1gdof2qcPuE832S?usp=sharing


## Tableau

*Insert your the image of your final bar chart here*

![Tableau](C:/Users/putch/OneDrive/Desktop/Tableau.jfif)



1. *What conclusions can you draw from the chart?*

The chart shows the difference of sum of sales for each category vs region.

## Observable and Vega-Lite

### A Taste of Observable

1. *In the "New York City weather forecast" section, try replacing `Forecast: detailedForecast` with `Forecast: shortForecast`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens?*

Details about forecast have been changed and the explanation about the forecast becomes short.

1. *Under the scatterplot of temperature vs. name, try replacing `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens? How about `markPoint()`?*

Shape of the dots changed to square in the plot when the markCircle changed to markSquare()

1. *Under "Pick a location, see the weather forecast", pick a location on the map.  Where was the point you picked near?*

Array values changes as we observe the change in latitude changing.

1. *The last visualization on this page is a "fancy" weather chart embedded from another notebook.  Click on the 3 dots next to that chart and choose 'Download PNG'.  Insert the PNG into your report.*

### Charting with Vega-Lite

`markCircle()`

1. *Pass an option of `{ size: 200 }` to `markCircle()`.*

![2](C:/Users/putch/OneDrive/Desktop/2.png)

1. *Try `markSquare` instead of `markCircle`.*


1. *Try `markPoint({ shape: 'diamond' })`.*

![3](C:/Users/putch/OneDrive/Desktop/3.png)

`vl.x().fieldQ("Horsepower")`, ...

1. *Change `Horsepower` to `Acceleration`*

![1](C:/Users/putch/OneDrive/Desktop/1.png)

1. *Swap what fields are displayed on the x- and y-axis*

![4](C:/Users/putch/OneDrive/Desktop/4.png)



1. *Change `Name` to `Origin`.*

When the name was changed to origin map showed country name.

Another example, `count()`

1. *Remove the `vl.y().fieldN("Origin")` line.*

The y-axis disappears and the data merges intlo single line
1. *Replace `count()` with `average("Miles_per_Gallon")`.*

The count() when replaced with average("Miles_per_Gallon")showed the average of the country.

## References

*Every report must list the references that you consulted while completing the assignment. If you consulted a webpage, you must include the URL.*
